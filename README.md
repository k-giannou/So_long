# So_long
It is a very small basic 2D game, in which the main character try to escape, after collecting all the keys. This project idea belongs to the 42 school and its purpose is to practice with textures, sprites, and some other very basic gameplay elements.

## So
- graphical library: the MiniLibX! This library was developed internally and includes basic necessary tools to open a window, create images and deal with keyboard and mouse events.
- Pressing ESC we quit the program in a clean way.
- The map can be composed of only these 5 characters:
  0 for an empty space,
  1 for a wall,
  C for a collectible,
  E for a map exit,
  P for the player’s starting position.
- The map must contain 1 exit, at least 1 collectible, and 1 starting position to be valid.
- The map must be rectangular.
- Check if there’s a valid path in the map.
- Make the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
